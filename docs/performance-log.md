# Performance measurements

Keep one row per useful experiment. Save raw JSON and charts in ignored
`test-results/performance/`; retain a small, synthetic baseline JSON alongside
this log when a comparison needs to survive checkout cleanup. Do not commit
household scenes, identifiers, credentials or screenshots.

Read [the measurement guide](performance.md) before comparing results. Lower p95
and fewer frames over 33.3 ms are the primary signals. A laptop mobile profile is
a regression proxy; a real phone validates mobile improvements.

| Date | Experiment / source | Environment | Frame p95 | >33.3 ms | Calls / triangles (median) | Interpretation |
| ---- | ------------------- | ----------- | --------- | -------- | -------------------------- | -------------- |

For future entries, include the report filename, source commit, profile, browser
and GPU, device power/thermal state, what changed, visual tradeoffs, and whether
the same phone confirmed the improvement. Keep CPU-throttled results in a
separate comparison series. Do not claim a win from a difference smaller than
the variation between repeated runs.
